# Fararjeh FGC

This is a Next.js project created for learning purposes. I'm using this project to both understand Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, as well as familiarise myself with web development concepts and HTML. The site is live and is being hosted by Vercel, you can visit it here: [Fararjeh](https://fararjeh-fgc.com/)

# One Month In
It's been approximately one month since I've begun this project. Below, I'll talk about progress made as well as technologies learnt.

### Progress Made
- Decided on a vision and aesthetic for the site. The site will be used to host information about me and my brand within the fighting game community. I, Fararjeh, am a content creator, coach, and competitor of Street Fighter 6, and this site will host all relevant links to my social pages as well as information about me and my services.

- The overarching site layout has been determined. A Home page with short summaries of the different avenues of my brand, with clickable links that will direct users to more detailed pages with more information. My brand on a header at the top of the site, and a footer with my YouTube, Metafy, Twitter, and Twitch links.

### Technologies Learnt
- I've begun to understand the general functionality of Next.js, what it is, and why it's useful.
  
- I've learnt how file routing works within Next.js.
  
- API usage including generating API keys, environment variables, and caching values to be displayed on the site.
  
- I've deepened my understanding on the utility of CSS, specifically Tailwind CSS, and the niches filled by a `globals.css` file versus inline CSS.
  
- Testing, building, and deploying site builds with Next.js via Vercel.
  

# Two Months In
In about two months, I've taken my fledgling website and turned it into something I can utilise and be proud of.

### Progress Made
- Perfected and finalised aesthetic choices for the site, from page layout to fonts, images, information, etcetera.

- Refactored my site to fit nicely in a grid layout for better scaling with different aspect ratios.

- Made my site function flawlessly on any device, from mobile to PC, as well as enabling/disabling features such as hover elements on certain devices.

### Technologies Learnt
- I can confidently say I have a strong foundational understanding of React and Tailwind CSS.

- I know/understand how to test a website on different aspect ratios and optimise them accordingly.
  

# To Conclude
Overall, I am very happy with this project, and I can comfortably move onto the next project with the tools I've learnt under my belt. I will only return to this project to ammend/update information already existing on it; no further development will be taking place.
