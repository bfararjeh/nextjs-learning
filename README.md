This is a Next.js project created for learning purposes. I'm using this project to both understand Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, as well as familiarise myself with web development concepts and HTML.

# One Month In
It's been approximately one month since I've begun this project. Below, I'll talk about progress made as well as technologies learnt.

### Progress Made
- Decided on a vision and aesthetic for the site. The site will be used to host information about me and my brand within the fighting game community. I, Fararjeh, am a content creator, coach, and competitor of Street Fighter 6, and this site will host all relevant links to my social pages as well as information about me and my services.

- The overarching site layout has been determined. A Home page with short summaries of the different avenues of my brand, with clickable links that will direct users to more detailed pages with more information. My brand on a header at the top of the site, and a footer with my YouTube, Metafy, Twitter, and Twitch links.

### Technologies Learnt
- I've begun to understand the general functionality of Next.js, what it is, and why it's useful.
  
- I've learnt how file routing works within Next.js.
  
- API usage including generating API keys, environment variables, and caching values to be displayed on the site.
  
- I've deepened my understanding on the utility of CSS, specifically Tailwind CSS, and the niches filled by a `globals.css` file versus inline CSS.
  
- Testing, building, and deploying site builds with Next.js via Vercel.
  

## Conclusions
Overall, I've come to learn the fundamentals of Next.jss. From developing the site to adding extra features such as smooth animations and stylised text/images. My goal for the coming weeks is to acquire a domain and have the site publically available.

# Two Months In
In about two months, I've taken my fledgling website and turned it into something I can utilise and be proud of.

### Progress Made
- Perfected and finalised aesthetic choices for the site, from page layout to fonts, images, information, etcetera.

- Refactored my site to fit nicely in a grid layout for better scaling with different aspect ratios.

- Made my site function flawlessly on any device, from mobile to PC, as well as enabling/disabling features such as hover elements on certain devices.

### Technologies Learnt
- I can confidently say I have a strong foundational understanding of React and Tailwind CSS.

- I know/understand how to test a website on different aspect ratios and optimise them accordingly.
  

## Conclusions
Overall, I am very happy with this project, and I can comfortably move onto the next project with the tools I've learnt under my belt.
